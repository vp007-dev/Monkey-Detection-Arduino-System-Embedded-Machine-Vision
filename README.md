## üöÄ Project Overview

This project implements a **lightweight embedded vision system** using **ESP32-CAM** to detect:

- **Motion** in the camera feed
- **Approximate object height** to differentiate between **monkeys and humans**
- **Trigger digital output signals** for alarms, relays, or communication with an Arduino or IoT network.

It is designed for **forest edge farms, rooftop solar farms, or wildlife monitoring** where monkeys cause damage and need to be detected without complex AI servers.

## üéØ Features

‚úÖ Motion detection using grayscale frame differencing  
‚úÖ Object height-based classification (monkey vs human)  
‚úÖ Digital output trigger pin for alarms or Arduino integration  
‚úÖ Ultra-low-cost implementation using ESP32-CAM  
‚úÖ Easy to deploy and modify for other small animal detection tasks

## üìù How It Works

1. ESP32-CAM captures grayscale frames continuously.
2. Calculates **pixel-wise difference** with the previous frame.
3. If:
   - **Motion pixels exceed threshold** and
   - **Estimated object height < human height**,  
   it triggers the digital output pin.

4. The **trigger pin** can:
   - Directly activate a relay (with optocoupler driver), or
   - Send a signal to an Arduino for extended automation logic.
